## 🎯 Objectives

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning course (22/23) and aims to apply supervised learning techniques to both standard benchmark datasets (MONK’s) and a real-world regression task (CUP dataset). The core focus includes model selection, validation techniques, and performance evaluation.
